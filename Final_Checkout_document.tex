\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
Amid the ongoing cost of living crisis and the rapid shift in consumer behavior, large retailers are increasingly focused on improving operational efficiency and cutting costs to meet rising customer expectations. Recent disruptions, including global supply chain issues and changing labor dynamics, have amplified the urgency for more innovative, cost-effective solutions in the retail industry. While technological advancements have already revolutionized the checkout process, most notably with the introduction of contactless kiosks as the benchmark for modern Point of Sale (POS) systems, there is still untapped potential for further improvement. \\
By capitalizing on the most universally accessible tool, the smartphone, we have the opportunity to not only reduce costs but also redefine the customer experience. The current retail landscape demands flexibility, and utilizing smartphones as mobile POS systems is a natural progression. This approach can significantly reduce infrastructure costs, eliminate the need for fixed kiosks, and decrease reliance on labor-intensive processes. Existing solutions allow QR and barcode scanning, but this project goes beyond that, aiming to fully integrate smart devices into the shopping journey. By empowering consumers to scan and purchase items independently, we can deliver a frictionless, personalized retail experience that meets the evolving demands of today's shoppers, while future-proofing retail operations against future disruptions 

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The current issues within the economy due to the current inflation globally has caused for a need to reduce costs within the retail industry to place less burden on the consumer with a lack of leeway within produce and goods adaptations to the current POS systems and how to increase the efficiency and costs for the business whilst simplifying the process for the consumer are concerns of leading industry giants. \\

The main issues are as follows: \\
\subsubsection{Long wait times and congestion}

After completing their shopping, customers often face long queues at the checkout, especially during peak hours. This not only causes discomfort for customers, but also forces stores to operate more checkout counters or hire additional staff to maintain efficiency. These measures lead to increased costs and reduced customer satisfaction. 

\subsubsection{Increased costs}
Installing and maintaining traditional POS systems and kiosks incurs significant costs, which rise exponentially as the size of the store increases. Additionally, these systems require regular updates and maintenance, further driving up operational expenses.

\subsubsection{Lack of flexibility}
The current payment system relies on fixed checkout counters or kiosks, which makes it difficult to adapt to customer traffic flow or shopping patterns. This limitation hampers the store's ability to manage in-store congestion or offer more convenient options to customers.

\subsubsection{Limited customer experience}
Current payment systems do not provide customers with enough control over their shopping experience, such as real-time price checking or managing their shopping list. This limits customers' ability to self-manage information related to their purchases. \\

These issues lead to customer dissatisfaction and increase operational costs. Our project aims to address these problems by introducing a mobile-based payment system that increases efficiency, reduces costs and improves the customer experience by allowing a streamlined seamless method of payment. 

\subsection{Solution}
Our proposal is to solve this current problem through a mobile application that has the capabilities of functioning as a POS system within physical retails stores. 

With this solution, customers can avoid traditional checkout lines, significantly reducing congestion and wait times, especially during peak shopping hours. Since there is no need for physical POS kiosks or additional staff assistance, retailers can drastically lower their infrastructure and labour costs. Moreover, this system allows retailers to move beyond the limitations of fixed checkout counters, adapting more flexibly to fluctuating customer flows. 

Using smartphones also empowers customers to have more control over their shopping experience. They can access real-time information on prices, promotions, and their total cart value, easily add or remove items, and apply discounts automatically, completing transactions without physical interaction. This enhances convenience and safety, especially in the post-pandemic era where contactless solutions are highly valued. 

By integrating this mobile-based payment system, we aim to not only boost operational efficiency but also transform the overall shopping experience into a more flexible, cost-effective, and customer-centric retail environment.

\subsection{Directory organization}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Undefined/Success.html : This HTML page confirms a successful payment and interacts with a backend API to generate a receipt. It includes a header displaying a success message, and a footer with navigation links (home, scanner, receipts, cart, account). The script checks if the user is logged in by retrieving the user ID from localStorage. If not, it prompts the user to log in. After confirming payment, a POST request is sent to the backend API with the user ID in the headers. If the request is successful, a receipt is generated; otherwise, an error message is shown. The page is designed to be responsive and includes external CSS for styling.
  \item Undefined/Style.css: Provides a responsive, user-friendly design for a website, covering authentication, shopping, scanning, receipts, cart, account settings, and footer navigation. It resets default margin and padding for consistency, styles the body with a clean background, and centers the header. The authentication section includes a login button with hover effects. Shop and bookmark items are displayed using flexbox with hover effects. The scanner section is responsive, ensuring the video fits its container. Receipts and cart sections feature interactive list items with product details and removal options. Account settings offer action and logout buttons, with distinct hover effects. The footer navigation is fixed at the bottom, with icons that change color on hover. Media queries ensure responsiveness across devices, enhancing both functionality and appearance.
  
  \item Undefined/Stripe.html: Sets up a basic Stripe payment flow. It includes a header with a title, a button for triggering the payment process, and a footer with navigation links represented by icons for home, scanner, receipts, cart, and account pages. The JavaScript embedded in the page handles the payment logic by listening for a click on the "Pay Now" button. Upon clicking, it first checks if the user is logged in by retrieving the user ID from localStorage. It then fetches the user's cart data from a backend server and ensures the cart contains items. Afterward, it communicates with the backend to create a Stripe checkout session and redirects the user to Stripe's hosted payment page. If any errors occur during the process, relevant error messages are displayed, ensuring a smooth user experience.
  \item Undefined/Receipts.html: This HTML code displays a user's receipts. It includes a header with a title, a section for listing receipts dynamically injected into the page, and a footer with navigation links to other sections (home, scanner, receipts, cart, and account). The JavaScript manages the display of receipts by first checking if the user is logged in (using localStorage to retrieve the user ID). It then fetches receipt data from a backend server and populates the receipt list. Each receipt displays details like purchase date, total sum, and shop name, with an option to delete receipts. When clicked, each receipt can expand to show more details about the items purchased. If no receipts are available, a message is shown. The user can also delete receipts, and the list is reloaded after a successful deletion. If any errors occur during data fetching or deletion, relevant messages are displayed.
  \item Undefined/Index.html: This HTML page represents the home screen of an application, where users can view available shops and manage bookmarks. Upon visiting the page, the script checks for a valid user session through a stored ID token and displays user-specific information. The main content of the page consists of a list of shops, from which users can select a shop, and a list of product bookmarks with options to remove items from the list. The JavaScript first handles login redirects, storing user information in localStorage and updating the UI with a welcome message. The available shops are displayed as buttons, allowing users to select a shop. Upon selecting a shop, any previous cart content is cleared. Bookmarks are fetched from a backend API and displayed, with an option to remove them. The page dynamically loads and displays relevant user data based on login status, while handling errors and providing alerts when needed.
\item Undefined/Cart.html:	This HTML page represents a shopping cart for an e-commerce site. It allows users to view, update, and manage items in their cart. The JavaScript fetches cart data from the backend and dynamically displays it, showing product names, prices, quantities, and total cost. Users can adjust quantities, remove items, and toggle bookmarks for products. The checkout button is enabled only when the cart has items. Error handling is implemented for fetching data and updating quantities. The cart total is recalculated whenever items are added or removed. Additionally, navigation links in the footer provide quick access to other sections of the site.
\item Undefined/Barcode.html:	This HTML page is designed for scanning barcodes in an e-commerce environment. Using the Quagga library, it initializes a live camera feed to detect barcodes, specifically EAN and Code 128 types. When a barcode is detected, the page fetches product details from the server using the barcode, adds the product to the user's cart, and displays feedback. Error handling is implemented to ensure a smooth user experience, alerting users if the product cannot be fetched or added to the cart. The footer provides navigation links to other sections of the site, and the page also checks for user authentication via userId stored in localStorage.
\item Undefined/Auth.html:	This HTML page handles user login and displays checkout information. It contains a login button that redirects to an Azure AD B2C authentication endpoint. Upon successful login, the page retrieves the ID token from the URL, decodes it to extract user information (name, email), and displays it on the page. If no ID token is found, it logs a message indicating the user is not logged in.
\item Undefined/Account.html:	This HTML page displays and manages user account settings. It fetches and shows user profile details (name, first name, last name) by decoding the ID token stored in localStorage. If no ID token is found, it displays "Not logged in." The page also provides an "Edit Profile" button that links to an Azure AD B2C profile editing endpoint and a "Logout" button that logs the user out by redirecting them to the Azure AD logout URL. The page dynamically loads user data and handles logout actions.
\item Undefined/Server.js:	This Express server handles multiple API endpoints for an e-commerce application, including user authentication, product management, cart operations, bookmarks, and Stripe payment integration. It supports adding/removing products from the cart, updating quantities, handling checkout, and generating receipts. Additionally, it offers functionality for bookmarking products, clearing the cart, and processing successful payments via Stripe. Middleware extracts user IDs for secure operations, and PostgreSQL is used for data storage.
\item Undefined/Schema.sql:	This SQL code creates tables for managing an e-commerce system, including Products, Receipts, ReceiptItems, Bookmarks, and Cart. The Products table stores product details like name, description, barcode, and price. The Receipts table records purchase transactions, linking users and products, with the total sum and purchase date. ReceiptItems tracks product quantities and prices for each receipt. Bookmarks allows users to save products they are interested in, while the Cart table tracks products added to a user's shopping cart with quantity, price, and total amount. Foreign key relationships ensure referential integrity between these tables.
