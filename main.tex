\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
Amid the ongoing cost of living crisis and the rapid shift in consumer behavior, large retailers are increasingly focused on improving operational efficiency and cutting costs to meet rising customer expectations. Recent disruptions, including global supply chain issues and changing labor dynamics, have amplified the urgency for more innovative, cost-effective solutions in the retail industry. While technological advancements have already revolutionized the checkout process, most notably with the introduction of contactless kiosks as the benchmark for modern Point of Sale (POS) systems, there is still untapped potential for further improvement. \\
By capitalizing on the most universally accessible tool, the smartphone, we have the opportunity to not only reduce costs but also redefine the customer experience. The current retail landscape demands flexibility, and utilizing smartphones as mobile POS systems is a natural progression. This approach can significantly reduce infrastructure costs, eliminate the need for fixed kiosks, and decrease reliance on labor-intensive processes. Existing solutions allow QR and barcode scanning, but this project goes beyond that, aiming to fully integrate smart devices into the shopping journey. By empowering consumers to scan and purchase items independently, we can deliver a frictionless, personalized retail experience that meets the evolving demands of today's shoppers, while future-proofing retail operations against future disruptions 

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The current issues within the economy due to the current inflation globally has caused for a need to reduce costs within the retail industry to place less burden on the consumer with a lack of leeway within produce and goods adaptations to the current POS systems and how to increase the efficiency and costs for the business whilst simplifying the process for the consumer are concerns of leading industry giants. \\

The main issues are as follows: \\
\subsubsection{Long wait times and congestion}

After completing their shopping, customers often face long queues at the checkout, especially during peak hours. This not only causes discomfort for customers, but also forces stores to operate more checkout counters or hire additional staff to maintain efficiency. These measures lead to increased costs and reduced customer satisfaction. 

\subsubsection{Increased costs}
Installing and maintaining traditional POS systems and kiosks incurs significant costs, which rise exponentially as the size of the store increases. Additionally, these systems require regular updates and maintenance, further driving up operational expenses.

\subsubsection{Lack of flexibility}
The current payment system relies on fixed checkout counters or kiosks, which makes it difficult to adapt to customer traffic flow or shopping patterns. This limitation hampers the store's ability to manage in-store congestion or offer more convenient options to customers.

\subsubsection{Limited customer experience}
Current payment systems do not provide customers with enough control over their shopping experience, such as real-time price checking or managing their shopping list. This limits customers' ability to self-manage information related to their purchases. \\

These issues lead to customer dissatisfaction and increase operational costs. Our project aims to address these problems by introducing a mobile-based payment system that increases efficiency, reduces costs and improves the customer experience by allowing a streamlined seamless method of payment. 

\subsection{Solution}
Our proposal is to solve this current problem through a mobile application that has the capabilities of functioning as a POS system within physical retails stores. 

With this solution, customers can avoid traditional checkout lines, significantly reducing congestion and wait times, especially during peak shopping hours. Since there is no need for physical POS kiosks or additional staff assistance, retailers can drastically lower their infrastructure and labour costs. Moreover, this system allows retailers to move beyond the limitations of fixed checkout counters, adapting more flexibly to fluctuating customer flows. 

Using smartphones also empowers customers to have more control over their shopping experience. They can access real-time information on prices, promotions, and their total cart value, easily add or remove items, and apply discounts automatically, completing transactions without physical interaction. This enhances convenience and safety, especially in the post-pandemic era where contactless solutions are highly valued. 

By integrating this mobile-based payment system, we aim to not only boost operational efficiency but also transform the overall shopping experience into a more flexible, cost-effective, and customer-centric retail environment.

The recommendations may include related products, promotional items, or other goods that the customer might be interested in, which can be added directly to the shopping cart. It also uses machine learning models to improve the accuracy of its suggestions over time.
 
\subsection{Module 9: Geolocation Services} 
The Geolocation Services module allows the system to track the location of the user or kiosk in real time. This is especially useful in a grocery store setting where location-based features like store-specific promotions or proximity-based product recommendations can improve the customer experience.

This module uses the user’s device location (via GPS or IP-based geolocation) to provide context-aware services. For example, it can track the user’s position within the store and offer location-based promotions, such as discounts for items near the user’s current location. It also allows the system to direct customers to specific aisles or product categories within the store based on where they are located. Additionally, it can assist in creating a more efficient self-checkout experience by providing real-time updates on nearby available products.


\section{Use Cases}
\subsection{Sign Up}
The first page that users see is the sign-up or login page. On the sign-up page, users can enter their information such as username, password, name, email, and address to register. Once they fill out the necessary details and complete the sign-up process, their information is saved in the database for future logins.

\subsection{Login}
Users can log in using the username and password they created during the sign-up process. When a user attempts to log in, the system verifies if the information matches the data in the database. If the credentials are incorrect, a login failure message is shown. If they are correct, the user is logged in successfully and redirected to the main page of Checkout.

\subsection{Main Page}
Once logged into Checkout, the first page users will see is the main page. At the top of the Checkout main page, users can find their profile picture, name, and a welcome message. If it's the user's first time logging in, clicking "Start Checking Out" will show a tutorial for new users, explaining how to use Checkout and how to register a card.
The main page also displays recommended products, nearby markets where users can shop, and a list of recently purchased items. Users can click on a recommended product or a past purchase to see more details, including prices and purchase history.
When users click on a nearby market, the app integrates with a map application to show the route to the nearest store. The bottom navigation bar provides easy access to other pages within Checkout.
